      An interactive game that vibrantly illustrates the evolutionary journey of the Cowgret, a captivating hybrid born from the fusion of a cow and an egret. 

Users begin by controlling the egret, illustrating the mutually beneficial partnership between these creatures. As the egret consumes more flies, it transforms into a hybrid of the two, allowing users to engage with this newly evolved Cowgret.
